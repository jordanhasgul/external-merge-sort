# External Merge Sort
A simple command line program for sorting large data sets stored in the [CSV file format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values).

## Description
External sorting algorithms are a class of sorting algorithms that are capable of handling vast amounts of data. Such algorithms are required when the data to be sorted does not fit into the main memory and, instead, they must reside in the slower external memory. The chosen algorithm used to sort large data sets is the 2-way [external merge sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_sorting#External_merge_sort).

The algorithm works as follows:
