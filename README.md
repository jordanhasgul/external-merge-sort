# External Merge Sort
A simple command line program for sorting large data sets stored in the [CSV file format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) through the use of an external sorting algorithm.

## Description
External sorting algorithms are a class of sorting algorithms that are capable of handling vast amounts of data, for example large data sets. Such algorithms are required when the data to be sorted does not fit into the main memory and, instead, they must reside in the slower external memory. A 2-way [external merge sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_sorting#External_merge_sort) was chosen to sort these large data sets.

The algorithm works as follows:

1. **Splitting of file into sorted runs**\

2. **Iterative merging of the sorted runs**\
